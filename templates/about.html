<br>
Cryp-TA Sentinel is a capstone project meant to showcase most of what I have learned to do with Python so far.
It is meant to demonstrate the application of newly acquired skills using the REST api, flask, numpy, pandas, matplotlib,
and the core Python libraries, all in one project. It is also meant to prove that I am capable of developing a fullstack
webapp and deploying it on the internet.
<br>
<br>
Cryptocurrency was chosen as the topic of focus because it is one of interest in the technology sector and because Blockchain
technology is very much a part of many technology circles today. Furthermore, Cryptocurrency financial data, is made publicly
available and easily accessible, providing an opportunity to practice working with historical timeseries data
(in this case mostly Open High Low Close Volume data or OHLCV) and to demonstrate basic data wrangling, cleaning, and
transformation techniques (for example, almost all the indicators are derived from transformations of the base OHLCV data
using either <a href="https://pypi.org/project/TA-Lib/"> TA-lib </a> or basic Python + numpy + pandas) picked up from
taking online courses and over the course of "failing and then learning" how to code and work with datasets.
<br>
<br>
As per the disclaimer that appears on every page of this site, this webapp is not meant to give financial advice or to be
used to inform or encourage any type of financial trading activities whatsoever. It is only meant to showcase basic
learned skills as a novice Python software developer thus far.

Below are some resources that made creation of this webapp possible by way of the educational and tutorial materials
they make available. Without them It would have not been possible to figure out
how to code or build a basic webapp such as this. It is hoped these resources will also help others who want to learn.
