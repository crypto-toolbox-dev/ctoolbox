# analysis_tool_webapp

This app is meant to bring toghether most of what I have learned as a budding
Python dev through self teaching, trial and error, online courses, and lots of
googling.

It is a simple Flask webapp that uses basic Python libraries such as
requests, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib to gather, wrangle, clean, and plot data.

The app also uses TA-lib to transform ohlcv data into technical analysis
indicator data for plotting.

The topic of cryptocurrency was chosen becuase there are many free APIs that
allow ease of access to timeseries financial data, and because 
technical analysis is heavily used in cryptocoin market analysis. 

The app is not meant to give financial advise or to be used to inform any type
of trading activity and this is explicitly reiterated throughout the app
templates. 

It is simply meant to showcase junior python development skills and nothing
more.
